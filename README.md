# weather-dashboard
The goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard, so that a user could get the weather of a city.  The website needed to take a user input and be able to store it in local storage and display the previous searches on the left of the screen.  The page also needed to be able to use the Weather API and day.js to be able to get the weather and current date to display on the page.  

The biggest challenge I faced when creating this website was, figuring out how to access the information given in the api and display it on the screen.  I solved this by calling certain functions in the api response call.
